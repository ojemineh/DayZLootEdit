An editor to comfortably modify the loot table of the game "DayZ (Standalone)".


---


**Version 0.3.14**  
**[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/ojemineh/DayZLootEdit/releases)**

This tool requires at least **Windows 7 SP1** & **.NET Framework 4.8**.



## Usage


The loot table of DayZ (Standalone) is stored in a XML file inside the current mission.
The file is called `types.xml` and can be found in the `mpmissions` folder in the server files or the game files. For the current version of the game it's stored in the following location: `\mpmissions\dayzOffline.chernarusplus\db\types.xml`

Usually the file from the dedicated server has to be changed.
Changing the file in your local game folder will only affect yourself while playing in offline mode.

To start, open the file `types.xml`.
